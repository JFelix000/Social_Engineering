        <h1>What is Social Engineering</h1>
        <p>In its most simple definition, social engineering is the manipulation of a person by a another individual
            with the intent of extracting sensitive or personal information from them. This can be done through a
            multitude of ways including phising, baiting, pretexting, etc. A more in depth look at these methods can be
            found <a href="types.html">here</a>. </p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>

        <p>Since the beginning of the internet cyber attacks and hacking have always been a threat to individuals. For this reason, people have always come up with new methods for creating safeguards from these attack. While these protections against malicious attacks have become better and better as time goes one there is always a weakness to them that hackers try to exploit. All protections and safeguards contain one common weakness, that being the people that use them on a daily basis. These hacking techniques are known as social engineering. In its most basic definition, social engineering is the manipulation of a person by another individual with the intent of extracting important or personal information from whatever victim.</p>
