        <p>In its most simple definition, social engineering is the manipulation of a person by a another individual
            with the intent of extracting sensitive or personal information from them. This can be done through a
            multitude of ways including phishing, baiting, pretexting, etc. A more in depth look at these methods can
            be
            found <a href="types.html">here</a>. One of the defining aspects of social engineering is an attacks
            reliance on human psycology rather than technical aspects. While yes, social engineering attacks sometimes
            include some sort of malware or virus that infects the victims computer, they rely more heavily on tricking
            the victim into divulging valuable information rather than just harvesting the information from the victims
            computer. By doing so, social engineering attacks are more difficult to prevent as no software or antivirus
            can truly protect against them. </p>

        <h1>Who Does it?</h1>
        <p>Social engineering is most often performed by hackers or identity theives attempting to gain access of
            something from their victims, more specifically private or personal information such as a home address or
            account login. Using this information hackers are able to gain access to the victims accounts, typically
            bank or saving accounts, and take what they'd like from them like a persons entire life savings. Once the
            hacker has this informaton it can be difficult to get back and fix any damage caused by them.

        <h1>Impact</h1>

        <p>Since the beginning of the internet cyber attacks and hacking have always been a threat to individuals. For
            this reason, people have always come up with new methods for creating safeguards from these attack. While
            these protections against malicious attacks have become better and better as time goes one there is always
            a weakness to them that hackers try to exploit. All protections and safeguards contain one common weakness,
            that being the people that use them on a daily basis. These attacks can be devastating to individuals or
            companies as they allow someone to take advantage of the information that they gain and use it as they
            wish. This can result in thousands, even millions, of dollars in damages which could potentially ruin a
            person depending on the extent of the damage. </p>
