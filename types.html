    <h1>Types of Social Engineering</h1>
    <p>Social enginnering comes in many forms, some being more time and labor intensive than others. </p>
    <h2 id="online1">Online Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li id="online1">Phishing</li>
        <p>Perhaps the most common example of social engineering seen today is phising. With phishing scams, the
            individual trying to recieve information from their victum sends malicious content in the form of emails
            with links or attachmets. Such attacks typically cause the victum to feel a sense of urgency when or fear
            with the intent of making them act on a matter quickly. Such scams are accompished by impersonating a
            trusted figure and asking the victum for sensitive or personal information in order to have the issue
            resolved.

        <li id="online2">Baitting</li>
        <p>Baiting is a form of social engineering in which the individual offers their victum a reward in exchange of
            information. These sites usually come in the form of sites that say the victum is the winner of a free
            gift. The user is then required to input personal information in order to claim their reward. From this
            hackers or identity theifs are able to gain access to private informations includign the victums address or
            credit card information.</p>
        <hr>
        <li id="online3">Pretexting</li>
        <p>Another for of Social engineering is pretexting. Pretexting is when an individual fabricates a story that
            allows
            them to ask another individual for a </p>

    <h2>In Person Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tailgating</li>
        <p>In tailgating, an individual phisically gains access to an area that they have no authoirzation to by
            following
            behind an employee who is authorized to enter the area. The individual typically impersonates another
            figure,whether made up or real, and creates a fabricated story as to why they are there. </p>
