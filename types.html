    <!-- Begining of text content available fro users to read. -->
    <!-- The section elements with a class of main seperates this text from what was written above allowing for it to be styles differently within the CSS. -->
    <section class="main">
        <!-- The h1 element makes the text within its tags larger when compared to other text, usually indicating an important title or heading. -->
        <h1>Types of Social Engineering</h1>
        <!-- The p element creates a paragraph within the section element with the class of main. -->
        <p>Social engineering comes in many forms, some being more time and labor intensive than others. Different
            methods can also be catagorized as either <strong>online methods</strong> or <strong>in-person methods</strong>.</p>
        <hr>
        <!-- Comments made above apply to the rest of the elements nested within the section elemnts with the class of main. The only variation between some elements is the use of either an h1, h2, or li element for certain heading. -->
        <!-- Ids seen within wither h2 or li element are placed there as to allow for the links displayed in the side nav to bring the user to the proper section of text it correlates to when clicked.  -->
        <h2 id="online"> Online Methods</h2>
        <p>Most methods of social engineering involve aspects of online contacts between both the hacker and the person
            they are trying to obtain information from. This contact can vary from method to method icluding a single
            target email or a wide target bait site. </p>

        <img src="Images/spamemail.png">
        <li id="online1">Phising</li>

        <p>Perhaps the most common example of social engineering seen today is phising. With phishing scams, the
            individual trying to recieve information from their victim sends malicious content in the form of emails
            with links or attachmets. Such attacks typically cause the victim to feel a sense of urgency when or fear
            with the intent of making them act on a matter quickly. Such scams are accompished by impersonating a
            trusted figure and asking the victim for sensitive or personal information in order to have the issue
            resolved.</p>
        <hr>

        <li id="online2">Baiting</li>
        <p>Baiting is a form of social engineering in which the individual offers their victim a reward in exchange of
            information. These sites usually come in the form of sites that say the victim is the winner of a free
            gift. The user is then required to input personal information in order to claim their reward. From this
            hackers or identity thieves are able to gain access to private informations including the victims address
            or
            credit card information
        </p>
        <hr>

        <li id="online3">Pretexting</li>
        <p>Another for of social engineering is pretexting. Pretexting is when an individual fabricates a story that
            allows them to ask another individual for certain private and personal information. This fabrication is
            meant to leave little uncertainty between the individual and their victim as to not arouse suspicion when
            the individual asks for such information. The use of pretexting requires a substantial amount of knowledge
            on the victim or company in order to make the story seem as plausible as possible.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <li id="online4">Watering Hole</li>
        <p>In watering hole attacks, the individual locates a website frequently visited by their targets and exploits
            vunerabilities in the site . Once a method to bypass the sites security is found, the individual them
            infects the site with a variety of
            malware. Unlike phising, using a water hole allows the idividual to wait for their victims to come to them
            rather than having to send an emails to the person. This attack recieves its name from its likeness to how
            a predetor in the wild would wait for its prey to come to a watering hole knowing that eventually they
            would. </p>
        <hr>

        <h2 id="person">In Person Methods</h2>

        <p>While the most commonly seen types of social engineering are seen online, in person methods exists as well.
            These methods are performed through physical actions including following the person into a restricted area
            or impersonating a real life figure to gain access to physical content such as files or confidential data
            stored locally.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <li id="person1">Tailgating</li>
        <p>In tailgating, an individual physically gains access to an area that they have no authorization to by
            following
            behind an employee who is authorized to enter the area. The individual typically impersonates another
            figure,whether made up or real, and creates a fabricated story as to why they are there. This type of
            social engineering mostly occurs in a company or business setting. Similar to pretexting, the individual
            must have a substantial knowledge on the company in order to not arouse suspicion.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <img src="Images/ninja.png" alt="ninja">
        <li id="person2">Impersonation</li>
        <p>Impersonation is when the individual attempting to obtain information disguises themselves as another
            individual. This type of social engineering, when done in person, is more often seen in a business setting
            like tailgating. The use of impersonation can be found throughout almost all methods of social engineering
            as the individual
            wanting to obtain information is usually under the disguise of someone else in order to receive the
            information they want. The person or entity that the individual may impersonate can vary greatly from
            either an employee or a corporate higher-up.
