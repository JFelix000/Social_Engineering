    <h1>Types of Social Engineering</h1>
    <p>Social enginnering comes in many forms, some being more time and labor intensive than others. </p>
    <h2>Phishing</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most common example of social engineering seen today is phising. With phishing scams, the individual
        trying to recieve information from their victum
        sends malicious content in the form of emails with links or attachmets. Such attacks typically cause the victum
        to feel a sense of urgency when or fear with the intent of making them act on a matter quickly. Such scams are
        accompished by impersonating a trusted figure and asking the victum for sensitive or personal informatioon in
        order to have the issue resolved.

    <h2>Tailgating</h2>
    <p>In tailgating, an individual phisically gains access to an area that they have no authoirzation to by following
        behind an employee who is authorized to enter the area. The individual typically impersonates another figure,
        whether made up or real,
        and creates a fabricated story as to why they are there. </p>
