        <h1>Types of Social Engineering</h1>
        <p>Social engineering comes in many forms, some being more time and labor intensive than others. </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="online"> Online Methods</h2>
        <p>Most methods of social engineering involve aspects of online contacts between both the hacker and the person
            they are trying to obtain information from. </p>
        <hr>
        <img src="Images/spamemail.png">
        <li id="online1">Phising</li>

        <p>Perhaps the most common example of social engineering seen today is phising. With phishing scams, the
            individual trying to recieve information from their victim sends malicious content in the form of emails
            with links or attachmets. Such attacks typically cause the victim to feel a sense of urgency when or fear
            with the intent of making them act on a matter quickly. Such scams are accompished by impersonating a
            trusted figure and asking the victim for sensitive or personal information in order to have the issue
            resolved.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <li id="online2">Baiting</li>
        <p>Baiting is a form of social engineering in which the individual offers their victim a reward in exchange of
            information. These sites usually come in the form of sites that say the victim is the winner of a free
            gift. The user is then required to input personal information in order to claim their reward. From this
            hackers or identity theifs are able to gain access to private informations includign the victims address or
            credit card information</p>
        <hr>

        <li id="online3">Pretexting</li>
        <p>Another for of social engineering is pretexting. Pretexting is when an individual fabricates a story that
            allows them to ask another individual for certain private and personal informatin. This fabrication is
            meant to leave little uncertainty between the individual and their victim as to not arouse suspicion when
            the individual asks for such information. The use of pretexting requires a substantial amount of knowledge
            on the victim or company in order to make the story seem as plausible as possible.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2 id="person">In Person Methods</h2>

        <p>While the most commonly seen types of social enginnering are seen online, in person methods exists as well.
            These methods are performed through physical actions including following the person into a restricted area
            or impersonating a real life figure to gain access to physical content such as files or confidential data
            on a computer. </p>

        <hr>
        <li id="person1">Tailgating</li>
        <p>In tailgating, an individual phisically gains access to an area that they have no authoirzation to by
            following
            behind an employee who is authorized to enter the area. The individual typically impersonates another
            figure,whether made up or real, and creates a fabricated story as to why they are there. This type of
            social engineering mostly occurs in a company or business setting. Similar to pretexting, the individaul
            must have a substaintial knowledge on the company in order to not arouse suspicion. </p>

        <hr>
        <li id="person2">Impersonation</li>
        <p>Impersonation is when the individual attempting to obtain information disguises themselves as another
            individual. This cThe use of impersonation can be found throughout almost all methods of social engineering
            as the individual
            wanting to obtain information is usually under the disguise of someone else in order to receive the
            information they want.</p>
