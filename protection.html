        <h1>How to Protect From Social Engineering:</h1>

        <h2>Determining Secure Info</h2>
        <p>Social engineering issues are recently on the rise, and enterprises are paying the price for not keeping
            their documents secure. The system administrator of any company needs to be aware of the possible threats
            that appear in society today. Contracts and Commercial Documents are few of the things that need to be kept
            secure from any outsiders, along with sensitive information of the employees. Most of the time, people will
            keep their company documents safe by allowing only a few people to access higher tier documents.</p>

        <h2>Keeping Software Relevant</h2>

        <p>Not only should your software be up to date for the purposes of productivity, but certain add-ons can make
            protecting yourself from suspicious users that much easier. For example, <strong>Social Engineering Land
                Mines,</strong> or SELM, are a great way to block out attempts of inexperienced hackers. The slightest
            protection could help make the biggest difference when it comes to corporate safety. There shouldn't be any
            room for neglecting those important files <blockquote>“SELMs refers to system traps laid to stop or expose
                an attack. As the name suggests, they are usually set to ‘explode’, by surprise, in an attacker’s face.
                In the process, it exposes the attack’s secrecy, crippling the process and eventually stop the attack.
                In addition, <strong>SELM</strong> will notify the victim’s system and the victim of the attempt to
                enable additional security measures to be implemented immediately” (Ghafir, 2016, p. 148).</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>In addition, there are many companies that like to dedicate their efforts to selling phishing protections
            which the system administrator can decide upon for their company.</p>

        <h2>Awareness of Suspicious Acts</h2>
        <p id="robber"/>Odd characters can make an
            appearance in person as well; quite often, people will pretend to be in a position of authority to access
            your documents and passcodes. Machine phone calls are another way that scammers can get you through
            recordings that request your information. In this process called <strong>vishing</strong>, they copy the <strong>Interative
                Voice Response</strong> of companies to gain your trust. Scammers often using phishing as a way of
            attacking victims and have hacked people by using real law firms to act out a court date for the victim.
            The email would say something along the lines of, <em>"click this link to see your court date"</em> and
            when done, it instantly downloads and installs a malware onto your computer. Every employee needs to secure
            the information that criminals may want to take from a company. For example, they should look to protect
            from random people asking for specific information. Most of the time these people will appear as friendly
            and trustworthy, but it is important for the employees to be constantly reminded about people who want
            their information for <em>vicious</em> reasons.</p>
