            <dt id="ex1">2011-RSA SecureID Attack</dt>
            <dd>In 2011 four employees of a network security company, RSA, fell victim phishing emails that led to a
                company wide disaster. The way the attack worked was the recipients opened an email containing two
                attachments. One was to find a weak and vulnerable spot in the computer's security and the other
                attachment "snuck into" the computer's files and from there was able to give the hackers the access
                they were looking for. Remediation for investigating lost productivity and lost revenue costed roughly
                $70 million</dd>
            <hr>
            <dt id="ex2">2013-Department of Labor Watering Hole Attack</dt>
            <dd>In 2013 the U.S Department of Labor was hacked. When visitors opened the website they were unknowingly
                fell victim to a watering hole attack. Watering hole attacks are a form of social engineering where a
                website is made to look like the official one but reality they are sites with malware installers that
                “infect” a computer with malware. In with respect to this incident it was the government's website and
                only certain pages were “infected.” With it being the government website that was hacked they never
                released who or how many had been infected and did not state weather sensitive information was
                obtained. The hackers were never identified.</dd>

            <dt id="ex3">2013-Yahoo! Costomer Account Compromise</dt>
            <dd>Another famous case where social engineering was took place was in 2013 at Yahoo! At first, the reports
                stated that about 500 million accounts were breached. In 2017, about four years later, the true number
                of over three billion accounts came out. It was reported that emails, email addresses, birthdays and
                more were compromised. No bank account information was directly compromised, but with the information
                that was breached could have been sold on the blackmarket where the information bought could be used to
                gain access to those accounts. Due to a single email and an employee, an internet giant and its
                billions of customer’s data were breached; an unfortunate, yet excellent example of social engineering.

            <dt id="ex4">2014-Sony Pictures Hack</dt>
            <dd>Many large corporations have fallen victim to social engineering and its many forms. A well-known
                example of social engineering was in 2014 when Sony Pictures was hacked. In late November 2014 Sony
                Pictures was hacked by a group that called itself the GOP (Guardians of Peace). Some claims by
                employees say that the hackers were phishing; using Apple ID password requests to gain access to their
                accounts. Through phishing, the North Korean hackers were able to successfully wipe several Sony
                computers and made threats of releasing private information. It is thought that one of the motives for
                the attack was over the movie The Interview. In the movie, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, the
                two are sent to North Korea to assassinate the dictator, Kim Jong Un. The, alleged, korean hackers are
                thought to have found the movie offensive and demanded that the movie not to be shown. Using a specific
                type of social engineering called phishing the hackers were successful on their mission; Sony released
                the movie online and there were a couple theatre that it was played in.</dd>
